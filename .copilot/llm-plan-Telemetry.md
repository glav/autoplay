# Plan: Telemetry

## Phase 1: Analyze Requirements
- [x] Task 1.1: Review the current implementation of OpenTelemetry in runtime_init.py
- [x] Task 1.2: Identify the imports and code blocks that need to be modified

## Phase 2: Modify OpenTelemetry Integration
- [x] Task 2.1: Move OpenTelemetry imports inside conditional block checking for config.ENABLE_TRACE_LOGGING
- [x] Task 2.2: Create dummy trace interface for when tracing is disabled
- [x] Task 2.3: Refactor configure_oltp_tracing function to handle both enabled and disabled cases

## Phase 3: Test & Verify
- [x] Task 3.1: Verify the solution addresses the requirement of not loading OpenTelemetry when disabled
- [x] Task 3.2: Ensure backward compatibility when tracing is enabled

## Checklist
- [x] Only import OpenTelemetry modules when ENABLE_TRACE_LOGGING is True
- [x] Provide dummy trace interface when tracing is disabled
- [x] Maintain existing functionality when tracing is enabled
- [x] Ensure configure_oltp_tracing function works in both cases

## Success Criteria
- [x] OpenTelemetry modules are not imported when ENABLE_TRACE_LOGGING is False
- [x] Application continues to work as expected when tracing is disabled
- [x] No changes to functionality when tracing is enabled
